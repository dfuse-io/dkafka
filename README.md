# dkafka
kafka cloudevent integration


# Usage

* Compile with `go install -v ./cmd/dkafka`
* Run with:
```
  # assuming a dfuse instance with blocks running on localhost:9000
  # assuming a kafka instance running on localhost:9092 without auth

  dkafka publish \
     --dfuse-firehose-grpc-addr=localhost:9000 \
     --start-block-num=2  \ 
     --stop-block-num=180 \

# Notes on transaction status and meaning of 'executed' in EOSIO

* Reference: https://github.com/dfuse-io/dkafka/blob/main/pb/eosio-codec/codec.pb.go#L61-L68
* Transaction status can be one of [NONE EXECUTED SOFTFAIL HARDFAIL DELAYED EXPIRED UNKNOWN CANCELED]
* From a streaming perspective, you are *probably* only interested in the transactions that are *executed*, in the sense that their actions can modify the *state* of the chain
* There is an edge case where a transaction can have a status of SOFTFAIL, but includes an successful call to an error handler (account::action == `eosio::onerror`, handled by the receiver) -- in this case, the the actions of this transaction are actually applied to the chain, and should *probably* be treated the same way as the other *executed* transactoins.
* If you want only include all actions that are *executed* in that sense (including the weird SOFTFAIL case), use the field `executed` in your CEL filtering or look for a 'true' value on the `executed` field in your event.

# CEL expression language

* Reference: https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md

* The following flags on dkafka accept CEL expressions to generate a string or an array of strings:
  * *--event-type-expr*  "CEL" --> `string`
  * *--event-keys-expr* "CEL" -->  `[array,of,strings]`
  * *--event-extensions-expr* : "key1:CEL1[,key2:CEL2...]" where each CEL expression --> `string`
  * *--dfuse-firehose-include-expr*  "CEL" --> `bool`

* the following names are available to be resolved from the EOS blocks, transactions, traces and actions.
  * `receiver`: receiver account, should be the same as the `account` unless it is a notification, ex: `eosio.token`, `johndoe12345`.   
  * `account`: namespace of the action, ex: `eosio.token`
  * `action`: name of the action, ex: `transfer`
  * `block_num`: block number, ex: 234522
  * `block_id`: unique ID for the block, ex: `0002332afef44aad7d8f49374398436349372fcdb`
  * `block_time`: timestamp of the block
  * `step`: one of: `NEW`,`UNDO`,`IRREVERSIBLE`
  * `transaction_id`: unique ID for the transaction, ex: `6d0aae37ab3b81b6783b877f2d54d4708f9f137cc6b23374641be362ff010803`
  * `transaction_index`: position of that transaction in the block (ex: 5)
  * `global_seq`: unique sequence number of that action in the chain (ex: 4354352435)
  * `execution_index`: position of that action in the transaction, ordered by execution
  * `data`: map[string]Any corresponding to the params given to the action
  * `auth`: array of strings corresponding to the authorizations given to the action (who signed it?)
  * `input`: bool, if true, the action is top-level (declared in the transaction, not a consequence of another action)
  * `notif`: bool, if true, the action is a 'notification' (receiver!=account)
  * `executed`: bool, if true, the action was executed successfully (including the error handling of a failed deferred transaction as a SOFTFAIL)
  * `scheduled`: bool, if true, the action was scheduled (delayed or deferred)
  * `trx_action_count`: number of actions within that transaction
  * top5`_trx_actors`: array of the 5 most recurrent actors in a transaction (useful for big transactions with lots of actions)

* examples:
  * to generate two events per action, one with 'account' as the key, one with the 'receiver' as the key (duplicates are removed automatically)
    `--event-keys-expr="[account,receiver]"`
  * to set the key to 'updateauth' when the action match, but 'account-{action}' for any other action:
    `--event-keys-expr="action=='updateauth'?[action] : [account+'-'+action]"`
  * to add a header `ce_newaccount` in kafka mesage with the value "yes" it is the action eosio::newaccount "no" ortherwise:
    `--event-extensions-expr="ce_newaccount:account+':'+action=='eosio:newaccount'?'yes':'no'"`

# Decoding DBOps using ABIs

* --local-abi-files flag allows you to specify local JSON files as ABIs for the contracts for which you want to decode DB operations, ex:
```
curl -H "Content-type: application/json" -XPOST "localhost:8888/v1/chain/get_abi" --data  '{"account_name":"eosio"}' | jq -c .abi >eosio.abi
curl -H "Content-type: application/json" -XPOST "localhost:8888/v1/chain/get_abi" --data  '{"account_name":"eosio.token"}' | jq -c .abi >eosio.token.abi
dkafka publish \
  --dfuse-firehose-grpc-addr=localhost:9000 \
  --start-block-num=2 \
  --stop-block-num=180 \
  --dfuse-firehose-include-expr="executed && action!='onblock'" \
  --batch-mode \
  --dry-run \
  --local-abi-files=eosio.token:./eosio.token.abi,eosio:./eosio.abi
```

* --abicodec-grpc-addr flag allows you to specify the GRPC address of a dfuse "abicodec" service, so dkafka can fetch the ABIs on demand, ex:
```
dkafka publish \
  --dfuse-firehose-grpc-addr=localhost:9000 \
  --start-block-num=2 \
  --stop-block-num=180 \
  --dfuse-firehose-include-expr="executed && action!='onblock'" \
  --batch-mode \
  --dry-run \
  --abicodec-grpc-addr=localhost:9001
```

* --fail-on-undecodable-db-op flag allows you to specify if you want dkafka to fail any time it cannot decode a given dbop to JSON
